# Week  4 assignment in Developing data products course on Coursera

This repository contains Shiny web application that demonstrates a part of real world IoT system - RoBox, where industrial devices are equipped with data driven quality control modules. Each of the modules is built on RPi and runs control software. Thereby there are two main tasks to be done:
* control of quality of service of the industrial devices
* monitoring of the quality controle modules themsleves
This is achieved through simple monitoring of the CPU load, CPU temperature as well as time of the last updates. Knowing this it is possible to reason about the modules operational staus along with the workload since it is directly dependent on industrial device activities.
